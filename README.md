# WELCOME to PDF's castle


# MAIN FEATURES:
  - File manager (CASTLE): you can manage a hierarchy of folders and pdfs by imports and drag and drop.  
      The file manager is a tree structure, each item has a parent starting from a ROOT NODE which is the vault path.  
    
  - Web pdf viewer: microsoft edge in-app implementation, you can view, rotate, print and save your pdfs.  
      A PDF is rendered by the WebView2 engine, essentially a little Microsoft Edge inside the software.  
  
  - Pdf editor: crop, labels, sign...
      Build a simple pdf editor is too expensive, for this reason I opted a delegation to orher software the user can choose.
      Essentially, you can choose your favorite pdf editor to use.

# HOW IT WORKS:
  - C#
  - .NET 8
  - WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
  - WebView2 

# HOW CAN I TRY IT? 
  - no relase version avaiable yet (coming soon...)  
  - you can install Visual Studio with WPF and .NET 8 and just run the project.
