WELCOME to The Lord of PDFs


MAIN FEATURES:
  - File manager (CASTLE): you can manage a hierarchy of folders and pdfs by imports and drag and drop.
      The file manager is a tree structure, each item has a parent starting from a ROOT NODE which is the vault path.
    
  - Web pdf viewer: microsoft edge in-app implementation, you can view, rotate, print and save your pdfs.
      A PDF is rendered by the WebView2 engine, essentially a little Microsoft Edge inside the software.
  
  - Pdf editor: crop, labels and sign.
      Work in progress...

HOW IT WORKS:
  - C#
  - .NET 8
  - WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
  - WebView2 

HOW CAN I TRY IT? 
  - no relase version avaiable yet (coming soon...) 
  - you can install Visual Studio with WPF and .NET 8 and just run the project.
